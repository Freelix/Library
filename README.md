Library
=======

Store books and movies into a database. You can also add books by their bar code with a scanner.

There is also a powershell script to retrieve information with the bar code. The application doesnt't use that script though. It takes an API from isbn to complete that goal. It's faster and easier to use. The ps1 script was only created for the purpose of testing something different.
